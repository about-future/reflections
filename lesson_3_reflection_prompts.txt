When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When i use more than one pc or at the same project works more than one person.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because, if more than one person works on the project, it might overlap my files with the files commited
    by another contributor.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are online clones between two Github accounts/two contributors
    Clones are offline copies of an online or offline repository
    Branch is an other approach to the same project, a ramification which
    could contain a new feature or a different solution to the problem or
    even a new set of rules to the same project. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I can merge my copy with any changes that were done remotley while i was offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would email the file with the change and explain what i've changed by email or by phone.
    None would be easier, i belive if you get some experience with Git and Github, this is the
    easiest way so far to collaborate.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
